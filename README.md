###   About the Project
ActiveNet Trainer is a program designed to simplify the way new employees learn
to use our Registration System. From managing customer accounts, reserving facility
locations and processing lagoon permits, ActiveNet is at the center of it all.

The ActiveNet Trainer project is implemented using LITMOS training systems, and our use is handled at the domain [CityofCarlsbadParksandRec.litmos.com](https://cityofcarlsbadparksandrec.litmos.com/home).
Users can log into our system and read documentation, complete tutorials using
ActiveNet trainer tools and be tested on their learned skills. **All exams are set so that you may only miss 1 (one) item per test. If you miss more than one item, you must recomplete it.**

Along with the in-course tools, the stakeholders-new staff, have the ability to download
the documentation for use at a later point in time - when needed.

We understand that each facility is different and partakes in different activities.
To address this, we sorted classes by future employee access in the system. For
example, those who work at Calavera Hills Community Center will have Course Enrollment
whereas those working at the Dive-In Grille will solely have access to POS functions.

###   Document Types
To ensure that the documents can be edited in the future, and can be managed as tutorials
instead of just presentations, we needed to ensure that they were interactive. In
the original form, the tutorials were created using [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) to enable this interactivity.
However, since Omnigraffle is solely a MacÂ® product, this is unsuitable for those who
may need to edit the project in the future.

To fix this issue, all documents have been converted into [Powerpoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/powerpoint) presentations,
enabling the internal bookmarking feature to work similarly to Omnigraffle.

Bookmarking is done as simply as creating an object on a page and setting the hyperlink
to a page within the current document. When this object is selected, the document jumps
to the set page and the user may continue. The critical feature of this, however, is
to export the document to PDF form, so that users can easily view the documents as expected
on a variety of machines, and paper, without losing quality. Bookmarking remains functional
after export.

###    File Location
To be consistent with the file structure, and to reduce the amount of time used on Git, I have downloaded the latest copy into the *[Community]('J:\ActiveNet\ActiveNet & W2W Training Documentation')* drive on your computer. Here, you may find the last documents updated by myself and you may continue the current tasks.

###    Asana Project Management
In the duration of this project, we used Asana as our Project Management software. While helpful (and free), the project is no longer being updated on the site. For current status updates, please see the current Sr. Management Analyst.
